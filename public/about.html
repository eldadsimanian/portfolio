<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm a first-year Computer Science student in the Honors (Magnet) Program at HIT, finishing my first year with a
  99.95 GPA while actively serving over 270 days in the IDF reserves. I’m disciplined, curious, and thrive on
  self-learning—diving into new technologies and turning ideas into working software.</p>

<p>Technically, I work with C, C++, Java, and C#. Recent projects include a full Taki card game in C# (Windows Forms)
  with an SQL-backed leaderboard and game logic/AI, and a Smart Warehouse manager in C# featuring clean OOP design and
  JSON serialization. I enjoy data structures, OOP, and building practical automations (e.g., n8n, LLM/agent flows).</p>

<p>I’m looking for a student software developer role (internship/part-time). I can combine work with studies and prefer
  afternoon hours. I bring teamwork and problem-solving skills sharpened during my 8200 service, a strong work ethic,
  and a genuine drive to learn fast and deliver. Let’s build something great together.</p>
